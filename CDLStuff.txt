I can not access Google Docs this way, you'll have to download a pdf and upload to Buzz.
You can do this by going to the top left of your Google Doc, selecting File > Download > PDF and resubmit so I can re-grade. This short video might help as well: https://youtu.be/zxnBu8PFW2s?t=33 

Please paste the questions above your answers, they will help you while you're answering!
Assignments need to be converted to a pdf and submitted that way, please message me on Genius if you need help doing this.
Re-submit I'll grade.
