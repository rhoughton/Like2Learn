As you navigate through this makeshift blog, please don’t hesitate to reach out to correct, criticize, or complement. My first accepted pull request involved simple grammar fixes, but I was still overjoyed at contributing to the “open source” community. You can submit your own requests to this blog at this repository: https://github.com/rhoughton/Like2Learn 
If you like to learn about technology, and can bear with me as I share stories from teaching and family life, then this is the blog for you!  

There are three main sections to this site: 
<b>
Companion Texts,</b> where I take, usually very technical papers, and read through them pausing to ask questions. I’ll write a summary on the text and then below provide all the answers to these questions I’ve created. Use this however you’d like.  
<b>
Video University,</b> similar to the companion texts but with videos. Youtube is one of the world’s greatest innovations and the driving force behind “open source education.” This is a great resource for a poor boy like me who could never afford to attend the ivy leagues, or comply with enough gatekeepers to even gain acceptance.
<b>
Self Reflection,</b> here I simply reflect on my learning, and the work I’ve done and just journal openly about whatever comes to mind. My channel is constantly evolving and so am I, so sorry for my lack of a table of contents!
