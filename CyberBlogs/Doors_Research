What does DOORS stand for?
What's "built in" to DOORS?
What's possible with the Test Tracking toolkit?
OSLC?

Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System 
A "built in" database
Allows you to link requirements to test cases
Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration. 

*that's just the first page to their site, here is the User Manual:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYQBZ_9.6.1/com.ibm.rational.doors.integrating.doc/topics/doorsrmf_user_guide.pdf

The site doesn't explain this acronym: IRDRMFAO?
What's this FAO adding? 
What 3 types of links can exist?


But a manual explaining ITER requirements does: 
(IBM Rational DOORS Requirements Management Framework Add-On)
A process, data model and utilities are added to achieve a methodology in compliance with several standards.
3 links: allocated by, justified by, and refers to. There's a bonus! 'verifies' for validation testing


General Notes
-semantically no difference between 'module type' and 'template.'

*The ITER manual was so cool I decided to make another seciton on just it:
