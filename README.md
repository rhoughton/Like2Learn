# Like2Learn

This blog and the associated code is the result of the many shortcuts and clarification writings I've done over the years in order to better learn all things related to electrical technology. 
"Learn Like you'll live forever, and live like you'll die tomorrow." Now I switched that quote around to emphasize the learning part but here is the correct version with attribution: "Live as If You Were to Die Tomorrow—Learn as If You Were to Live Forever. A variation of the same message (in “Hadith”) is attributed to Muhammad: “Live for your afterlife as if you will die tomorrow, and live for this life as if you will live forever.” Some researchers attribute this quote to Desiderius Erasmus (1466 – 1536)."

<b>I like to think of myself as a "space bar warrior" on youtube, I watch videos and use the spacebar to ask and answer questions, and I make videos that requre ample use of the space bar for the same reason! </b>
